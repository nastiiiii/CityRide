# cityride-client-service
ClientService is a microservice that handles ride-related functionalities for clients. It is responsible for receiving ride requests from clients and providing them with the price of the ride. The microservice communicates with the BillingService to process the price calculation and enables the client to accept or decline the ride offer. Additionally, ClientService utilizes SignalR to send real-time ride status updates to the client. The microservice incorporates CRUD operations for managing client data and implements JWT token authentication for secure access.
